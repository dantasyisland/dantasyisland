### Hi! I'm Danny. Welcome To My GitHub

## I'm a developer in training and music teacher
- I'm currently developing projects from <a href="TeamTreehouse.com">Team Treehouse</a> and burning the candle at both ends over at [freeCodeCamp]

- 2021 Goals: Learn enough skills to start full stack development
